# imissemacs README

## Features

This extension backports a few standard behaviour from emacs, such as:

- `switchCharacters`: switches the character below the cursor with the previous one, bound on `ctrl+t`
- `underline`: in `restructuredtext` mode, tries to adjust / toggle adorments for the section title
- `newlineAndIndent`: in python mode, inserts a new line and tries go to the most appropriate indentation level

This extension also adds extra keybindings (i.e does not replace existing ones):

- `ctrl+a`: go to the beginning of the line,
- `ctrl+e`: go to the end of the line,
- `alt-<`: go to the beginning of the file,
- `alt->`: go to the end of the file,
